# SLAvatarKit
SLAvatarKit is a powerful and flexible library for creating expressive and dynamic avatars, including memojis and animojis. It serves as a compelling alternative to Apple's private AvatarKit, allowing developers to integrate customizable avatar features seamlessly into their iOS applications.

> [!NOTE]
> AvatarKit is currently in development and not yet ready for production use. You are welcome to test the [latest alpha/dev build](https://github.com/ScribbleLabApp/AvatarKit/releases/latest) at your own risk. We welcome feedback [here](https://github.com/ScribbleLabApp/AvatarKit/issues).
